# HowToGetThere v2

## Description
Project of the "HowToGetThere" application developed for the Algorithms and Data Structures course.
The project implements Dijkstra's algorithm and a simple hash table.
The program allows finding the shortest path between two cities
and provides the route that has been determined.

## Test Results
The application successfully passed 13 out of 14 tests. It is likely that improving the hash table implementation
would resolve the existing issue.

## Technology Stack
- Programming Language: C++
- Graph Theory
- Custom implementations of C++ standard library solutions:
  - Vectors
  - Queues
  - Hash maps

## Main Features
1. Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm
2. Finding the shortest path between cities
3. Presentation of the determined route

## Potential Areas for Improvement
- Optimization of the hash table implementation
